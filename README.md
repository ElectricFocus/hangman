# Final Project - Hangman

### Requirements

1. A bunch of words/sentences to play the game with! Like a data JSON file from our previous projects.
2. Be able to render Hangman's different state based on the number of wrong guesses.
3. Be able to display the correct guesses, and the remaining letters not yet gussed.
4. Handle the game states properly (win, lose, new game, etc...)

#### Stretch Requirements (Nice to have, but not MVP)

1. Multiplayer options
2. Difficulty options
